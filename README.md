Web Scraping with python

Using the "Inspect" feature of web browsers, such as the "Inspect Element" functionality,
 can be helpful in web scraping to inspect the HTML structure of a webpage and identify the specific elements you want to extract.

 Here's how the "Inspect" feature can aid in improving your scraping code:

 1. Identify element selectors: By inspecting the HTML structure of a webpage, you can identify the HTML tags,
  class names, IDs, or other attributes associated with the data you want to extract. This helps you determine
 the appropriate selectors to use in BeautifulSoup to locate and extract the desired elements.

 2. Verify element attributes: Inspecting an element allows you to check its attributes, such as class names
  or IDs, to ensure they are accurate and up to date. This helps avoid attribute-related errors when using BeautifulSoup to extract data.

 3. Understand element hierarchy: Inspecting elements reveals their parent-child relationships and their position
 within the HTML hierarchy. This information is valuable for navigating the HTML structure using BeautifulSoup and selecting the correct elements for extraction.

 4. Examine element content: Inspecting an element allows you to view its inner text, attributes, and other related elements.
  This helps you understand the structure and organization of the data you want to scrape, enabling you to refine your code to extract the desired information accurately.

 Overall, the "Inspect" feature of web browsers empowers you to analyze the HTML structure of a webpage and make informed decisions about element
selection and data extraction when building your scraping code.
