The word 'sample' unfortunately also has another, quite different meaning in electronic music; it means a smallish section (usually a couple seconds long) of recorded sound. This chapter deals with the processing of short recorded bits of sound. First you'll have to learn how \"array\" works in Pd, which requires a fair amount of explanation.\n",

            "In Pd you can save sound to both locations. Saving to the hard disk means that you are saving a fixed sound file. WAV or AIFF formats are typically used. Use the \"writesf~\" object to write a sound file to disk. The argument is the number of channels; this creates a corresponding number of inlets to which you attach the sounds you want to record. First you have to use the message \"open [name]\" to choose the name of the file you want to create. Start recording using \"start\" and stop it using \"stop\".\n",
            " \n",
            "The other possible location is the main memory. Create one place for one sound using \"array\" (Put  Array then click \"ok\"). It is also a visualization of the sound.\n",
            "Let's first think of an array simply as storage for numbers. An array has a limited number of storage places. You can set this number using by right-clicking the array and going to \"Properties\". This opens two windows: one labeled \"array\" and the other labeled \"canvas\". In the \"array\" window, you can set the size. This number means the number of storage places. One number can be stored in each storage place.\n",
